# Title 
Pure Bash Dynamic Matrix (pbdm)

# Purpose
Make a matrix adaptive.
pbdm code is based on lsblk example.
If the author of lsblk changes the number of column <<SIZE>>, you don't need 
to know its new column number  to print its values: you'll always print them
only executing pbdm code.
	Rotating the matrix, you can use pbdm for rows too.
